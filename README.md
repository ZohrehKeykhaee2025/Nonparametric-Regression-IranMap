# Nonparametric Regression on Iran Map Shape

## Project Overview
This project applies nonparametric regression methods, including spline and kernel regression, to spatial data extracted from the outline of Iran’s map. The goal is to model the relationship between geographic coordinates and analyze the fitting performance.

## Key Features
- Extraction of Iran’s map boundary points from an image  
- Application of linear, kernel, and spline regression models  
- Visualization of regression results through scatter plots and fitted curves  
- Quantitative evaluation using standard metrics and spatial distance measures  

## Installation
Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then install required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scipy scikit-learn
